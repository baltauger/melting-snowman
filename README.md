# Melting Snowman

"Melting Snowman" is a modification / hack of the original Twine format "Snowman" to enable the writer to play some passages with a "speed reading" presentation.

## Snowman

[Snowman](https://github.com/videlais/snowman) is a minimal Twine 2 story format designed for people who already know
JavaScript and CSS. It's designed to implement basic functionality for playing
Twine stories and then get out of your way.

Snowman includes [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) for you.

# Usage

Melting Snowman works just like the original Snowman for all passage building purposes & conditionals, so go check out its own readme.md.

This is how you use the extra speed reading features:
